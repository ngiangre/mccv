## What is MCCV? {.smaller}

Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) is a predictive algorithm that combines prediction, cross validation, and statistical sampling.

## MCCV has been used as a prognostic tool to predict adverse outcomes in the future {.smaller}

## MCCV has been implemented as a python package {.smaller}

## MCCV determines a quantitative measure of prediction, compared to fold change and p-value cutoffs {.smaller}
