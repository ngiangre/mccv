One of the many subtasks wehn performing a prediction scheme is to include confounding variables. But what is a confounder and why include it? Counfounders can be illustrated using a causal diagram (From [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)):

As you can see, a confounding variable is something that confounds or 'confuses' the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. The relationship between an exposure X and an outcome Y is influenced by a confounding variable Z.

Here, I will show how MCCV can be used to identify confounders.

# Generate dataset with X, Y, and Z variables

```{python}

import numpy as np
N=100
Z1 = np.random.normal(loc=0,scale=1,size=N)
Z2 = np.random.normal(loc=1,scale=1,size=N)
Z = np.concatenate([Z1,Z2])
Y = np.concatenate([np.repeat(0,N),np.repeat(1,N)])
X = Z + np.random.normal(loc=0,scale=1,size=len(Z))
```

```{r}

df <- tibble::tibble(
    X = reticulate::py$X,
    Y = reticulate::py$Y,
    Z = reticulate::py$Z
)
df[['Y']] <- factor(df$Y,levels=c(0,1))

df

GGally::ggpairs(df)
```

# Employ MCCV: Predict Y from X, Y from Z, Y from X and Z

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data={'X' : X,'Y' : Y,'Z' : Z})
df.index.name = 'pt'

X = df.loc[:,['X']]
Y = df.loc[:,['Y']]
Z = df.loc[:,['Z']]
XZ = df.loc[:,['X','Z']]

```

```{python}
import mccv

mccv_YXobj = mccv.mccv(num_bootstraps=200,n_jobs=2)
mccv_YXobj.set_X(X)
mccv_YXobj.set_Y(Y)
mccv_YXobj.run_mccv()

mccv_YZobj = mccv.mccv(num_bootstraps=200,n_jobs=2)
mccv_YZobj.set_X(Z)
mccv_YZobj.set_Y(Y)
mccv_YZobj.run_mccv()

mccv_YXZobj = mccv.mccv(num_bootstraps=200,n_jobs=2)
mccv_YXZobj.set_X(XZ)
mccv_YXZobj.set_Y(Y)
mccv_YXZobj.run_mccv()
```

```{python}

f_imp_dfs = dict()
f_imp_dfs['YXobj'] = \
mccv_YXobj.mccv_data['Feature Importance']
f_imp_dfs['YZobj'] = \
mccv_YZobj.mccv_data['Feature Importance']
f_imp_dfs['YXZobj'] = \
mccv_YXZobj.mccv_data['Feature Importance']

```

# Visualize feature importances

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

f_imp_plot <- function(x,title){
    ggplot(x,aes(feature,importance,color=feature)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha=0) +
    geom_point(position=position_jitter(width=0.2)) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("X" = "indianred",
                                "Y" = "skyblue",
                                "Z" = "black",
                                "Intercept" = "gray")) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title=title)
}

library(patchwork)
(f_imp_plot( reticulate::py$f_imp_dfs$YXobj,"Y ~ X" ) +
    f_imp_plot( reticulate::py$f_imp_dfs$YZobj,"Y ~ Z" ) ) /
    f_imp_plot( reticulate::py$f_imp_dfs$YXZobj,"Y ~ X + Z" )
```

In this example, Z is confounding the relationship between X and Y. The 'Y \~ X' model shows that X is very important in predicting Y. However, when Z is included in the model 'Y \~ X + Z', you see that Z remains very important but X is no longer important for predicting Y.
