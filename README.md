# mccv: A python package to perform Monte Carlo Cross Validation

Based on the algorithm developed and implemented by Giangreco et al. (see references).  

![](docs/imgs/MCCV Prediction scheme.pdf)

# Objectives

1. To easily implement and perform MCCV for learning and prediction tasks.
2. To choose between different machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting Machhines
3. To ingest dataframes and return dataframes from the learning task. 

# Installation

```
...
cd mccv/
pip3 install .
```
