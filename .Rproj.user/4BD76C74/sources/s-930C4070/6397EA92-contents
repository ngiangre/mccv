# Introduction

Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) is a predictive algorithm that combines prediction, cross validation, and statistical sampling. This notebook will showcase the performance of MCCV when predicting a binary classification by biomarkers of different distributions.

# Outline

::: {.incremental}

1.  Nick Giangreco developed data mining and prediction methodologies at Columbia University
2.  Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) is a statistical learning algorithm developed for predicting data distributions
3.  MCCV has been used as a prognostic tool to predict adverse outcomes in the future
4.  MCCV has been implemented as a python package
5.  MCCV determines a quantitative measure of prediction, compared to fold change and p-value cutoffs
